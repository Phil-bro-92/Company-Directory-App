## Brief

Company Directory is a mobile first website that will operate equally well on desktop. The application has a simple UI, providing intuitive and user friendly navigation.

Company data is presented to the user in three distinct tables - Employees, Departments and Locations. A search function allows for filtering of the respective tables. Users can easily add, edit or remove information from the tables, dependant on inter-table dependencies .

The system utilises a mySQL database consisting of three tables - personnel, department and location. Relevant information is returned, created, updated or removed using SQL queries in PHP routines. Calls to these PHP routines are made using AJAX functions. The application also utilises the Bootstrap framework, giving it a clean, modern look.
